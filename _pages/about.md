Hi! My name is Arad Maleki Toolabi, a final-year undergrad B.Sc. student of Computer Engineering in 
[Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.ir), Tehran, Iran. My research interests are on **Efficiency**
and **Trustworthiness** of AI/ML systems, as I aspire to develop machine learning models that are well-suited
for widespread and large-scale deployment, where both efficiency and trustworthiness are crucial. In my free time,
I like to practice some guitar and play online chess. Feel free to 
[send a challenge](https://lichess.org/?user=AradMaleki#friend) if interested!


# Research Experience
Feel free to check out [my papers](papers)!

I've had the opportunity of researching several topics in **Trustworthy ML**. Specifically, I have
experience working on the following topics:
* Backdoor Attacks
* OOD Detection
* Adversarial Attacks
* Hallucination in Foundation Models

I am eager to explore opportunities to further advance my work on developing trustworthy models, 
especially on large generative models.

For **Efficient ML**, one can categorize the existing approaches into *algorithmic* and *system-level*. My previous
research has been mostly focused on system-level approaches, specifically in multi-GPU systems, spanning topics
such as:
* Model and Data Parallelism
* Workload Distribution
* Cache Management

I haven't had the opportunity to conduct research on algorithmic approaches to efficient ML. However, I am inspired
by works such as [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135), [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685), 
and [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314), and would like to pursue similar topics.
